    "This activity uses data from the CMS detector at CERN's LHC. It's actually the same activity we've used in [Quarknet's Data Camp at Fermilab](https://quarknet.i2u2.org/content/quarknet-data-camp) for several years, but using Python to pick it apart instead of a spreadsheet. The files contain collision events. You'll begin by looking at the events which included two muons in the decay products. \n",
