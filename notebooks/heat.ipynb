    "UCF undergraduate Michael Antia, who started the development of this notebook, was funded by Orange County Schools to make scientific computing a standard part of every middle school science class. This notebook was designed by [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/), who coordinated its development as the [PhysTEC](https://www.phystec.org/) Teacher-in-residence in the [University of Central Florida's Physics department](https://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/). Finally, thanks to the great folks at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjF96bdrO_bAhXD0FMKHUhAA-kQFggpMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3A5aPK2kLFzKOzb6sOckVw) for making this notebook interactive without you needing to download it or install Jupyter on your own device.
