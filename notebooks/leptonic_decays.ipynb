    "This activity uses data from the CMS detector at CERN's LHC. It's actually the same activity we've used in [Quarknet's Data Camp at Fermilab](https://quarknet.i2u2.org/content/quarknet-data-camp) for several years, but using Python to pick it apart instead of a spreadsheet. The files contain collision events. You'll begin by looking at the events which included two muons in the decay products. \n",

    "This notebook was designed by [Quarknet](https://quarknet.i2u2.org/) Teaching and Learning Fellow, [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/). The handy csv files were created from run2011A primary datasets and converted from ROOT format by the masterful [Tom McCauley](https://github.com/tpmccauley). More can be found on the [CERN OpenData](http://opendata.cern.ch/?ln=en) site, like [here](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/545). Finally, thanks to the great folks at [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjF96bdrO_bAhXD0FMKHUhAA-kQFggpMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3A5aPK2kLFzKOzb6sOckVw) for making this notebook interactive without you needing to download it or install Jupyter on your own device.
