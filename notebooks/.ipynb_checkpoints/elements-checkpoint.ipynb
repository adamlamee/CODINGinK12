    "The data came from Penn State CS professor [Doug Hogan](http://php.scripts.psu.edu/djh300/cmpsc221/p3s11-pt-data.htm). UCF undergraduates Sam Borges, who located the data, and Lissa Galguera, who formatted it, were funded by Seminole County Schools to make scientific computing a standard part of every middle school science class. This notebook was designed by [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/). Thanks to the great folks at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for making this notebook interactive without you needing to download it or install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) on your own device.
