    "The data came from the [Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission](https://myfwc.com/). UCF undergraduate Hunter T., who started the development of this notebook, was funded by Orange County Schools to make scientific computing a standard part of every middle school science class. This notebook was designed by [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/), who coordinated its development as the [PhysTEC](https://www.phystec.org/) Teacher-in-residence in the [University of Central Florida's Physics department](https://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/). Thanks to the great folks at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for making this notebook interactive without you needing to download it or install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) on your own device.
