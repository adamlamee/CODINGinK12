    "The data come from the [USGS earthquakes page](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php). This notebook was created by Physics teacher and Quarknet member Peter Apps, York Middle/High School, Retsof, NY, and further developed by [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/). Thanks to the great folks at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for making this notebook interactive without you needing to download it or install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) on your own device.
