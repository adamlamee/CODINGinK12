*May 3 & 4: I'm tinkering with the site layout and updating content. If something looks funny or you can't find what yo're looking for, drop an email to adamlamee@gmail.com.*  
*Thanks, Adam*

Thanks for visiting the [CODINGinK12.org](http://www.CODINGinK12.org) project. You can access the activities in at least three ways:  
- (requires a *Google* login) Click on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)] next to any activity below. You'll see a pop-up each time you run an activity for the first time telling you it's hosted on Github (it's secure, that's why we use it). Click "run anyway".  
- (requires a *Microsoft* login) Click on this button [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.svg)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to copy the entire set of activities to your cloud storage on Azure. As of May 2020 Azure doesn't support copying anything but the whole set of activities and data. If that changes, I'll update this page.  
- (requires software install) Right-click on (.ipynb) next to any activity to save it to your computer. Then, use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to open it. Find instructions are on the [implementing](./implementing) page.
