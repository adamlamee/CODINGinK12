*May 3 & 4: I'm tinkering with the site layout and updating content. If something looks funny or you can't find what yo're looking for, drop an email to adamlamee@gmail.com.*  
*Thanks, Adam*

Thanks for visiting the [CODINGinK12.org](http://www.CODINGinK12.org) project. 

## Running a coding activity  
### With a *Google* login  
Next to any activity below, click the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) button to open it in Google Colab. You'll see a pop-up each time you run an activity for the first time telling you it's hosted on Github (it's safe, that's why we use it). Click "run anyway".  
  
### With a *Microsoft* login  
Click on this button [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.svg)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to copy the entire set of activities to your cloud storage on Azure. As of May 2020 Azure doesn't support copying anything but the whole set of activities and data. If that changes, I'll update this page.  
  
### With Jupyter software installed
Right-click on (.ipynb) next to any activity to save it to your computer. Then, use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to open it. Find instructions on the [implementing](./implementing) page.  
  
## Start here  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb)) **Intro to Coding** is a 5-minute guide of how to use our activities. If you've never programmed before, this is a great place to start.  
  
## Earth & Space Science  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/quakes.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/quakes.ipynb)) **Quakes** uncovers plate tectonics using seismic data.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/global-temp.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/global-temp.ipynb)) **Global Temperatures** examines the effect of water on global climate using data from 1880-present.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/stars.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/stars.ipynb)) **Stars** uses a huuuuuge star catalogue to look for patterns in brightness and temperature, create an H-R diagram, and see constellations.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/tides.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/tides.ipynb)) **Tides** plots 5 years of sea-level height data to study the relationship between tides, moon phase, and the seasons.  

## Physics & Physical Science  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/elements.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/elements.ipynb)) **Elements** looks for trends in the periodic table.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/matching-position-graphs.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/matching-position-graphs.ipynb)) **Matching Position Graphs** models motion and practices relating algebraic equations with the graphs they represent.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/matching-velocity-graphs.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/matching-velocity-graphs.ipynb)) **Matching Velocity Graphs** models motion and practices relating algebraic equations with the graphs they represent.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/invariant-mass.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/invariant-mass.ipynb)) **Invariant Mass** let's you practice doing math (and the Pythagorean theorem) while you learn some basic of relativistic kinematics with data from CERN's LHC.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/leptonic-decays.ipynb) ([.ipynb](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/raw/master/notebooks/leptonic-decays.ipynb)) **Leptonic Decays @ CMS** applies conservation of charge, energy, and momentum to hunt for particles in data from CERN's LHC; used in Quarknet's Data Camp (grades 9-16).
