*May 3 & 4: I'm tinkering with the site layout and updating content. Sorry if something looks funny. If you can't find what you're looking for, drop an email to adamlamee@gmail.com.*  
*Thanks, Adam*

Thanks for visiting the [CODINGinK12.org](http://www.CODINGinK12.org) project. The [teachers page](./teachers) has pedagogy and implementation guides to help you integrate coding into your class. Visit the [about page](./about) to learn about the team and why thing this is so important.  

## How to Run an Activity  
**With a Google login**  
Next to any activity below, click the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) button to open it in Google Colab. You'll see a pop-up each time you run an activity for the first time telling you it's hosted on Github (it's safe, that's why we use it). Click "run anyway".  
  
**With a Microsoft login**  
Click on this button [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.svg)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to copy the entire set of activities and data to your cloud storage on Azure. As of May 2020 Azure doesn't support copying just a single activity. If that changes, I'll post an update here.  
  
**With Jupyter software installed**  
Find instructions and other implementation info on the [teachers](./teachers) page.  
  
## Start here  
**Intro to Coding** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb)  
It's a 5-minute guide on how to use our activities. If you've never programmed in a Jupyter notebook before, this is a great place to start.  
  
## Earth & Space Science  
**Quakes**  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/quakes.ipynb) Uncover plate tectonics using seismic data.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/global-temp.ipynb) **Global Temperatures**  
Examine the effect of water on global climate using data from 1880-present.  
  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/stars.ipynb) **Stars**  
Use a huuuuuge star catalogue to look for patterns in brightness and temperature, create an H-R diagram, and see constellations.  
  
**Tides** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/tides.ipynb)  
Analyze 5 years of sea-level height data to study the relationship between tides, moon phase, and the seasons.  

## Physics & Physical Science

Practice vector addition while you learn the basics of relativistic kinematics using data from CERN's LHC.  
  
**Leptonic Decays @ CMS** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/leptonic-decays.ipynb)  
Apply conservation of charge, energy, and momentum to hunt for particles in data from CERN's LHC; used in Quarknet's Data Camp (grades 9-16).
