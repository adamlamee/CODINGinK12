# Project Goals  
- **bridge the gap** between drag-and-drop coding games (like the wonderful work of [CODE.org](https://code.org/) and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)) and traditional *Intro to Computer Science* courses that teach programming from a blank terminal  
- **use pro-level software and languages** so students can continue to build upon their experiences through college and career  
- **increase equity and access** by reaching students through core courses with activities designed that teach science first, with coding as a tool  
- **make it easy to implement** by using intuitive, free software and fully-editable activities designed for teachers with no prior coding experience to experienced coders looking to customize  
-**develop activities on data science** to put research data into students' hands and to compliment the wealth of existing resources on simulation and animation, like the great stuff at [ComPADRE]( https://www.compadre.org/) using [vPython]( https://vpython.org/) and [Glowscript]( https://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/index.html)  
  
# The Team
[Adam LaMee](http://www.adamlamee.com) is the project lead and developed most of our activities. He’s a physics educator with decades of experience in curriculum development, assessment research, and data science who helped create Florida’s secondary course descriptions and teacher certification exams. He’s currently a [Quarknet]( https://quarknet.org/) Teaching and Learning Fellow and the PhysTEC Teacher-in-Residence at the University of Central Florida.  

Public scientific data couldn’t make it into our activities without staff to scour the web for it, then cleanse, reformat, document, cite, and finally organize it into a Juypter notebook accessible to the target student audience. Much of that was done by students at the University of Central Florida, either volunteering or paid by area school districts to help create activities for specific standards. Huge thanks to Megan Cox, Abryana Fergus, Kaitlyn Fisher, Lauren Gandy, Samantha Marginean, Allison Mignardi, Steven Nguyen, Andrew Pepper, James D. Rivers, Paola Santiago-Crespo, Zacchaeus Scheffer, Hunter T., Mitchell Todd, Tyler Townsend, and Carolynn Turneur. Quarknet high school teachers Peter Apps (York Middle/High School, NY) and Jeremy Smith (Herford, MD) and UCF CS grad Michael Smith also contributed by developing and improving upon several activities. They’re joined by hundreds of middle and high school teachers who have done the *real* work of adapting and implementing these activities with the next generation of computationally literate citizens and scientists.  
  
# Do students really need to learn how to code?  
There's increasing momentum for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Every student should be exposed to computer programming -- equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task.
