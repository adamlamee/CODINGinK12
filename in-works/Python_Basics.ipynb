    "Python is a programming language that is ideal for beginners and useful in data science. But what is a program? A program is simply a set of instructions, called code, written in a language (in this case, Python), usually with some goal in mind. Programming languages are more stringent than everyday languages. In English we can say \"the dog chased the ball\" or \"the ball is being chased by the dog\" or \"the dog went after the ball\" which all mean the same thing. In a language such as Python, there is typically only one way to write a command and the interpreter (which takes the commands and executes them) will be confused and let you know if you've made an error in syntax."
