## Saving Your Work  
This is running on a Google server on a distant planet and deletes what you've done when you close this tab. To save your work for later use or analysis you have a few options:  
- File > "Save a copy in Drive" will save it to you Google Drive in a folder called "Collaboratory". You can run it later from there.  
- File > "Download .ipynb" to save to your computer (and run with Jupyter software later)  
- File > Print to ... um ... print.  
- To save an image of a graph or chart, right-click on it and select Save Image as ...
