# Project Goals  
- **bridge the gap** between drag-and-drop coding games (like the wonderful work of [CODE.org](https://code.org/) and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)) and traditional *Intro to Computer Science* courses that teach programming from a blank terminal  
- **use pro-level software and languages** so students can continue to build upon their experiences through college and career  
- **increase equity and access** by reaching students through core courses with activities designed that teach science first, with coding as a tool  
- **make it easy to implement** by using intuitive, free software and fully-editable activities designed for teachers with no prior coding experience to experienced coders looking to customize  
-**develop activities on data science** to put research data into students' hands and to compliment the wealth of existing resources on simulation and animation, like the great stuff at [ComPADRE]( https://www.compadre.org/) using [vPython]( https://vpython.org/) and [Glowscript]( https://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/index.html)  

# Do students really need coding?  
There's increasing momentum for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Every student should be exposed to computer programming -- equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task. You may be surprised to see the [salaries and backgrounds](https://orlandodevs.com/blog/orlando-devs-salaries-2017) of computer programmers in Central Florida, courtesy of [Orlando Devs](https://orlandodevs.com/).  

# Our Story  
It began with a conversation between Particle Physicist [Sergei Gleyzer]( http://sergeigleyzer.com/) and Physics teacher [Adam LaMee](http://www.adamlamee.com). That led to a [US-CMS]( https://uscms.org/) mini-grant to fund Project CODER, a pair of workshops in the summer of 2016 hosted by the physics departments at [UCF]( https://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/) and [UF]( https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/) to expose middle and high school teachers to [CMS OpenData]( http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/about-cms) and [Jupyter notebooks]( https://jupyter.org/).  

By 2017, Adam was leading a staff of undergraduates and classroom teachers developing activities for students in Seminole County, one of Florida’s science leaders. We also developed activities on particle physics which have become staples for the [Quarknet program]( https://quarknet.org/)’s residential teacher workshop, Data Camp, held at Fermilab each summer. That was soon followed by an announcement from the Superintendent of Orange County Public Schools, the nation’s 9th largest school district with over 13,000 students per grade level:  

> “… students will gain meaningful exposure to coding in the Python programming language through traditional science instruction.”

&#9757; *That was us, too*. We started with five activities for each 6th grade science class districtwide, then again for 7th grade the next year. COVID-19 put us on pause, but we’re looking forward continuing with grades 8-12. Those students will have a competitive advantage over their peers when applying for skilled labor jobs, trade school, and university admissions. Want to do the same in your area?

# The Team
[Adam LaMee](http://www.adamlamee.com) is the project lead and developed most of our activities. He’s a physics educator with decades of experience in curriculum development, assessment research, and data science who helped create Florida’s secondary course descriptions and teacher certification exams. He’s currently a [Quarknet]( https://quarknet.org/) Teaching and Learning Fellow and the PhysTEC Teacher-in-Residence at the University of Central Florida.  

Public scientific data couldn’t make it into our activities without staff to scour the web for it, then cleanse, reformat, document, cite, and finally organize it into a Juypter notebook accessible to the target student audience. Much of that was done by students at the University of Central Florida, either volunteering or paid by area school districts to help create activities for specific standards. Huge thanks to Megan Cox, Abryana Fergus, Kaitlyn Fisher, Lauren Gandy, Samantha Marginean, Allison Mignardi, Steven Nguyen, Andrew Pepper, James D. Rivers, Paola Santiago-Crespo, Zacchaeus Scheffer, Hunter T., Mitchell Todd, Tyler Townsend, and Carolynn Turneur. Quarknet high school teachers Peter Apps (York Middle/High School, NY) and Jeremy Smith (Herford, MD) and UCF CS grad Michael Smith also contributed by developing and improving upon several activities. They’re joined by hundreds of middle and high school teachers who have done the *real* work of adapting and implementing these activities with the next generation of computationally literate citizens and scientists.
