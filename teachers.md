# Do students really need coding?  
There's increasing momentum for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Equal access to lucrative careers depends on every student being exposed to computer programming. You may be surprised to see the [salaries and backgrounds](https://orlandodevs.com/blog/orlando-devs-salaries-2017) of computer programmers in Central Florida, courtesy of [Orlando Devs](https://orlandodevs.com/). A dedicated computer science course, though, may not be the answer for all (or even most) students. Separate courses make it tough to reach students whose schedules are already full with remedial courses or electives, like team sports or the arts. Kids who ride the bus or don't have other transportation can miss out on after-school clubs, too. If we want to reach as many students as possible, required core subject area courses are where we should look. That's why our activities are aimed at content area teachers. It's mostly science at this point, but you can send suggestions or contribute an activity you wrote by emailing adamlamee@gmail.com.  

# The Tools We Use
### Python  
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programing language commonly used in scientific research and data science. You may have heard of other languages, such as C++, Java, Fortran, or BASIC. Python tends to have fewer syntax rules and extra characters making it more human-readable that some of the alternatives. That means students often can infer what the code does just by looking at it.  

Since we focus primarily on the science content, these activities don’t teach programming explicitly. If you or your students want to learn about loops, conditionals, functions, and other computer science fundamentals, there are high-quality free tutorials on the web. Check out [Python.org]( https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers), [Khan Academy]( https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science), [DataCamp.com]( https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science), and YouTube’s [Programming with Mosh]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc).  

### Jupyter  
[Jupyter]( https://jupyter.org/) is software that lets you write code and do useful things like open a data file, perform calculations, and create graphs. We use it like you would a spreadsheet program but instead of typing in cells, you type the instructions (*the code*) for analyzing and visualizing data. Researchers and computer scientists use it a places like CERN, NASA, IBM, Google, and Microsoft. Jupyter files are called *notebooks* so you may notice we use that term occasionally to describe our activities.  

Jupyter runs is a browser window which makes it appear more familiar – and less scary – than the blank computer terminal you might be imagining. The notebooks display the code and what the code outputs (text, tables, graphs) all in the same window and can include formatted text (bold, italics, font sizes), hyperlinks, and images so the activities can look more like instructional materials students usually interact with.  

The easiest was to run our activities is through an online interactive service like Google’s Colaboratory, described below. If you’d prefer to install Jupyter on your computer to run programs ‘locally’, download and install [Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). It contains Jupyter, Python, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff your computer will need.  

### Colab & Azure  
You can install Jupyter locally on you device, but for K12 schools getting software installed can be anywhere from tough to impossible. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb), or *Colab*, has revolutionized how we use Jupyter notebooks with students and in teacher professional development. The only downside is it requires a Google account. That may not be a big deal for you or your students, particularly if your school uses Google Classroom. Running a notebook on Colab is great for older computers since it doesn’t use your processor for the heavy lifting. Like any other Google Doc/Sheet/Slide, you can save it to your Drive and even have multiple users editing simultaneously. If you’d rather use a Microsoft product, there’s Azure which similarly let’s you run and save our notebooks in the cloud using your Microsoft or Outlook365 account. We haven’t used this service much (as of May 2020), but I’ll update here after using it in some workshops this summer.  

### GitHub  
[GitHub]( https://github.com/) is cloud storage, team collaboration, and version tracking all in one. Professional programmers and organizations use it to host their code and keep track of who made which edit when. We use it to host our notebooks and the data files they analyze. Colab has a great feature that allows us to create a URL that opens a notebook on GitHub in your own Colab window. The ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) buttons on the [home page](./index.md) do just that. As of May 2020, Azure doesn’t support linking to individual notebooks, but you can copy the entire project (all notebooks and data) to your Azure account and run them.

Teachers have enough to cover without adding computer programming to the list. Our goal is to use computer programming as a tool to address science content - the coding is secondary. You won't see loops and conditionals taught explicitly, but that allows non-CS-fluent teachers to use these activities with their classes. They also don't have much extra formatting, answer keys, or explanatory text. They work well for teachers new to scientific computing and, if you're a minimalist, can be used as-is with your students. If you prefer your students to have more detailed instructions, they're easy to edit for a different presentation, sequence, question type, etc. Google's Colaboratory has become our go-to platform for easy implementation in a variety of settings. It lets you run these Jupyter notebooks from any device with a browser (desktop, mobile, or otherwise). Want the raw notebook files? See the [project GitHub](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12). 

The resources you'll find here were developed by middle grades science teachers, undergrads at UCF, and me, [Adam LaMee](www.adamlamee.com). It all started with a mini-grant from US-CMS We piloted a few activities in Seminole County, FL in 2017. That caught the eye of neighboring Orange County Schools, currently the 9th largest district in the US with around 15,000 students per grade level. Orange County students now see these activities embedded in their 6th grade and 7th grade science curriculum, with plans to add grades 8th through 12th in the coming years. Those students will have a huge competetive advantage over their peers when applying for skilled labor jobs, trade school, or university admissions. Want to do the same in your area? Drop me a line at adamlamee@gmail.com.  

Use the activities linked above, write your own, or let us work with your team. We can also help you develop an implementation plan that suits your site's needs and resources. My colleagues and I conduct teacher workshops and district-wide professional development on coding, physical science content, reformed pedagogy, and digital literacy. These resources are free to use and modify (with credit), but not for resale. If you're a teacher using this with your own students, let us know how you're implementing it (because we're interested in that sort of thing). All others: see the license [here](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12) and kick an email this way.

- Modified activities used by [Orange County](https://github.com/ocps-codes) and by [Seminole County](https://github.com/SCPSscience) schools.
- [Code.org](https://code.org/) is the go-to place for fun, free activities for teachers and students to learn about coding.  
- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com) has great self-paced courses to teach yourself a programming language or new job skill. One of my former students used it to learn Python in a weekend, got a developer job that Monday, and a year later is at a cool startup, all without a college degree. And that's not uncommon.  
- [CERN Open Data](http://opendata.cern.ch/?ln=en) includes educational resources on particle physics and offers students (and the general public) the opportunity to access and analyze authentic data for the Large Hardon Collider. Yeah, it's pretty cool.
