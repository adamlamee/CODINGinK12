*Thanks, Adam*

If you like the activities and want to integrate coding into you class, school, or district, we're happy to share what has worked well for us and what hasn't. Below, you'll find a short description of each of the digital tools we use followed by advice on implementation at a range of scales.  

# The Tools We Use
### Python  
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programing language commonly used in scientific research and data science. You may have heard of other languages, such as C++, Java, Fortran, or BASIC. Python tends to have fewer syntax rules and extra characters making it more human-readable that some of the alternatives. That means students often can infer what the code does just by looking at it.  

Since we focus primarily on the science content, these activities don’t teach programming explicitly. If you or your students want to learn about loops, conditionals, functions, and other computer science fundamentals, there are high-quality free tutorials on the web. Check out [Python.org]( https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers), [Khan Academy]( https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science), [DataCamp.com]( https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science), and YouTube’s [Programming with Mosh]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc).  

### Jupyter  
[Jupyter]( https://jupyter.org/) is software that lets you write code and do useful things like open a data file, perform calculations, and create graphs. We use it like you would a spreadsheet program but instead of typing in cells, you type the instructions (*the code*) for analyzing and visualizing data. Researchers and computer scientists use it a places like CERN, NASA, IBM, Google, and Microsoft. Jupyter files are called *notebooks* so you may notice we use that term occasionally to describe our activities.  

Jupyter runs is a browser window which makes it appear more familiar – and less scary – than the blank computer terminal you might be imagining. The notebooks display the code and what the code outputs (text, tables, graphs) all in the same window and can include formatted text (bold, italics, font sizes), hyperlinks, and images so the activities can look more like instructional materials students usually interact with.  

The easiest was to run our activities is through an online interactive service like Google’s Colaboratory, described below. If you’d prefer to install Jupyter on your computer to run programs ‘locally’, download and install [Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). It contains Jupyter, Python, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff your computer will need. You can download our activities and data at [project GitHub](https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12) by viewing a file, then right-click on "raw". 
  

### Colab & Azure  
You can install Jupyter locally on you device, but for K12 schools getting software installed can be anywhere from tough to impossible. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb), or *Colab*, has revolutionized how we use Jupyter notebooks with students and in teacher professional development. The only downside is it requires a Google account. If your school uses Google Classroom, that's not a big deal. Running a notebook on Colab is great for older computers since it doesn’t use your processor for the heavy lifting. Like any other Google Doc/Sheet/Slide, you can save it to your Drive and even have multiple users editing simultaneously. If you’d rather use a Microsoft product, there’s Azure which similarly let’s you run and save our notebooks in the cloud using your Microsoft or Outlook365 account. We haven’t used this service much (as of May 2020), but I’ll update here after using it in some workshops this summer.  

### GitHub  
[GitHub]( https://github.com/) is cloud storage, team collaboration, and version tracking all in one. Professional programmers and organizations use it to host their code and keep track of who made which edit when. We use it to host our notebooks and the data files they analyze. Colab has a great feature that allows us to create a URL that opens a notebook on GitHub in your own Colab window. The ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) buttons on the [home page](./index.md) do just that. As of May 2020, Azure doesn’t support linking to individual notebooks, but you can copy the entire project (all notebooks and data) to your Azure account and run them.  

# Advice on Implementation  
### Feed your high flyers  
We've intentionally designed our activities to allow interested students to do further analysis than what's prompted and we're often amazed at what they come up with. If that's not enough, try suggesting these other free (and amazing) resources:  
- [CERN Open Data](http://opendata.cern.ch/?ln=en) includes educational resources on particle physics and offers students (and the general public) the opportunity to access and analyze authentic data for the Large Hardon Collider. Yeah, it's pretty cool.  
- [Particle Physics Playground](http://particle-physics-playground.github.io/), by Matt Bellis, provides Jupyter notebook exercises with particle detector data from CMS and CLEO.  
- [Shawn Weatherford's](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~sweatherford/) work on vPython and Glowscript.  
- [Let's Code Physics YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWBTKIyw-zX-2k63cB6qciQ)  
- [STEM Coding](https://u.osu.edu/stemcoding/)  

### Make it your own  
Our notebooks don't have much extra formatting or explanatory text. They work well for teachers new to scientific computing and, if you're a minimalist, can be used as-is with your students. If you prefer your students to have more detailed instructions, they're easy to edit for a different presentation, sequence, question type, etc. Seeing what [Seminole County](https://github.com/SCPSscience) and [Orange County](https://github.com/ocps-codes) created for their students may give you some ideas. We love hearing about how teachers are implementing or adapting this. Drop an email to adamlamee@gmail.com.
